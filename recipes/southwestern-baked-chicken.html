            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This is one of those backpocket meals I reach for whenever I'm short on time and need dinner on the table ASAP! Even my kid who isn't a fan of chicken will eat this up, so this one is definitely a keeper.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>nonstick cooking spray (OR oil)</li>
                    <li>4 chicken breasts (I used boneless, skinless and they weighed about 1 pound together)</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon taco seasoning</li>
                    <li>1 pepper (cored and diced (any color works; I used red))</li>
                    <li>1 (15-oz) can corn (drained)</li>
                    <li>1 (15-oz) can black beans (drained and rinsed)</li>
                    <li>1 (16-oz) jar salsa</li>
                    <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Prep: </strong>Heat oven to 400Â°F. Grease a 7x11 inch baking dish or spray with nonstick cooking spray. Place the chicken in the prepared dish and rub all over with taco seasoning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assemble: </strong>Evenly top chicken with diced pepper, drained corn and drain black beans. Spread salsa on top.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bake: </strong>Bake chicken in hot oven for 25 minutes. Carefully remove from the oven, top with cheese and return to oven for 5 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly and chicken is cooked through.</li>
                </ol>
