    <h2>Easy Chicken Quesadillas</h2>
        <p>This is such a quick and easy lunch or dinner recipe - it's ready in just 30 minutes and full of flavor.</p> 
        <p>All you need to do is cook the filling (don't worry, it won't take long), assemble the quesadillas and then brown them on the griddle or in a skillet.</p>        
        <p>Use homemade shredded chicken, buy a rotisserie chicken to shred or pre-shredded chicken... Or use leftovers from <a href="https://www.savorynothings.com/whole-roasted-chicken/">a whole roasted chicken</a>! This recipe can be as from-scratch or as convenient as you need it to be.</p>    
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chicken: </strong>It's easy to <a href="https://www.savorynothings.com/shredded-chicken/">make shredded chicken</a> at home - but rotisserie chicken or pre-shredded chicken also work here.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese: </strong>I use a Mexican blend, but Monterey Jack is also great. You can use shredded cheddar or a cheddar blend in a pinch, if that's all you have on hand.</li>
            <li><strong>Tortilla wraps: </strong>I love using large, grilled flour tortillas from Mission for my quesadillas (not sponsored in any way, genuinely the brand I prefer). Fell free to use any brand you like, but I do recommend sticking to the same size and to flour tortillas for these.</li>
            <li><strong>Red onion: </strong>White onion is a good substitute if you don't have red on hand, or simply leave it out if you are not a fan of onion.</li>
            <li><strong>Taco seasoning: </strong>I always use <a href="https://www.savorynothings.com/homemade-taco-seasoning/">my homemade taco seasoning</a>, but feel free to use your favorite store-bought.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sauté the red onion in olive oil over medium heat until fully softened, about 3-4 minutes. Then stir in the green onion and peppers and cook for another minute.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken and taco seasoning along with 4-6 tablespoons of water. Stir well and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the water has evaporated.</li>
            <li>Assemble the quesadillas: Scatter about 2 tablespoons of cheese over one half of a large tortilla wrap. Top with ¼ of the chicken filling, then sprinkle with more cheese and fold over.</li>
            <li>Brush the outside with oil and cook on a griddle or in a large, non-stick skillet over medium-high heat until browned on the outside and melty on the inside.</li>
            <li>Cut the quesadillas in half and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
