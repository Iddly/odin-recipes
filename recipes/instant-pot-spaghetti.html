            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Prep is so quick and easy for this recipe - a great way to make a <a href="https://www.savorynothings.com/simple-bolognese-sauce/">bolognese</a>-inspired pasta dish if you're short on time.</p>
                <p>Thanks to cooking in the instant pot with the sauce, the spaghetti soak up so much flavor when cooked under pressure this way. This makes the dish taste great, even though you barely have to do anything!</p>
                <p>Serve with parmesan cheese and chopped basil/parsley to make a simple recipe feel extra-special.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Spaghetti: </strong>You can also use penne or rigatoni in place of the spaghetti, if you prefer. As with the spaghetti, place the pasta on top of the meat mixture, cover with spaghetti sauce and don't stir before pressure cooking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Onion/Carrot/Celery: </strong>Feel free to leave any of these (or all of these) out if you prefer. You can also use a chopped green pepper in place of the celery. ½ teaspoon dried onion powder added with the other seasoning is fine to use in place of the fresh.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spaghetti Sauce: </strong>Just use your favorite jarred spaghetti sauce! I always use tomato basil. If you don't want to use ready-made spaghetti sauce, please don't substitute with canned diced tomatoes - they don't yield the same result. You can use plain tomato sauce and season it with some extra salt, garlic powder, onion powder and dried basil, if you prefer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Broth: </strong>Beef broth makes this a little richer and “beefier”, chicken broth is milder. If you have neither, you can use water, but there will be less flavor.</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Vegetables: </strong>Cook the vegetables in olive oil on the “sauté” setting until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Meat: </strong>Add the beef and cook until browned. Stir in all seasoning, then switch off.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spaghetti and Broth: </strong>Layer the halved, uncooked spaghetti evenly on top of the beef mixture. Pour the broth on top.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add Sauce and Cook: </strong>Evenly spread the spaghetti sauce over the spaghetti WITHOUT stirring anything up. Pressure cook for 6-10 minutes (depending on exact pasta, see notes below)</li>
                    <li><strong>Finish: </strong>Once the done with cooking, release pressure manually. Then stir very well and serve immediately.</li>
                </ol>
